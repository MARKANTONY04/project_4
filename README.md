### 1. UX

##### Project Goals

The goal of this project was to create a full stack gym website with payment methods to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have learned and used over the final module in the diploma I am studying. This is to show that I have the skills, knowledge and experience of a Junior Software Developer in working with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Django, Stripe, and other technologies, with the hope of one day gaining employment within this growing and impactful industry.



##### Developer and Business Goals

The business/developer goal of this gym website is to increase sales for their gym business. By creating a website for the gym, this would advertise the gym on the internet to help gain traction to increase sales. Furthermore, describing the equipment available with costs and descriptions of all the services on offer will help to gain traction within the community, persuading people to exercise in this establishment to create a successful business by allowing people to purchase gym subscriptions online.


#### User Goals

The user goal for this site is to have a clear purpose for the site, see what gym
services they have available with appropriate descriptions. Users will also want to purchase different services from the gym, including monthly gym subscriptions,
along with other services including meal plans and classes. Easy navigation, along
with good UX principles are also required to provide a great user experience for the site’s users.

#### User Stories

Here is a link to all the information about the user stories used in this project, I recommend checking it out to see the full picture of which features were added and why. It is available to the public, meaning anyone with access to this link should in turn be able to access these user stories:

[https://github.com/MARKANTONY04/project_4/issues] 

However, here is a summary of them below (in no particular order):

1. Page Layout

As someone who is unfamiliar with technology, computers, and the internet, I want
the page format to be in a standard page layout that includes a navbar, body, and
footer on each page that will allow me to easily be able to navigate this website.

2. Extensive Services

As a fitness enthusiast, I want to be able to see the all of the gym’s services on a single page, including gym subscriptions, gym classes, and nutrition guides so I can see a varied choice of services and know what I want to purchase.



3. Add to bag feature

As an avid shopper, I want to be able to shop on the go add purchases that I think I’ll want to buy to a bag, so by the time I get to checkout I can purchase everything I’ve selected at the same time.

4. Edit bag feature

As an excited shopper, I want to be able to edit, add and remove the purchases I add to my bag as I often add things I don’t need and want to increase the quantity of items I purchase, as well as the total cost.

5. Checkout feature

As an avid online shopper, I want a fully functioning checkout system, displaying the items I’ve places in my bag, allowing me to edit my order and display the total cost.

6. Services information

As a potential user of this establishment, I want to be able to see the price and
descriptions of all services this establishment offers so I can see if it’s right for me.

7. Home page

As a user who’s unaware of this establishment, I want to see the purpose of this
website on the home/welcoming page to understand the point of this website and
how it applies to me, the user.

8. Contact Details

As a user wishing to question the owner beforehand, I want a contact section with
the establishments contact details in the website’s footer so I can contact the
owner easily.

9. Location

As someone who’s new to the area and wanting to find a local gym, I want to see
the address on the website with a google maps map showing the location.

10. Pictures

As a gym enthusiast, I want to see pictures of this gym so I can know if it’s
facilities suit me.

##### Wireframes

Wireframes were used in the preparation of this project to help create the layout of the website that acted as a guide once I had commenced coding. These wireframes
were created in the inception phase of this project, as I was planning out ideas. They are seen here and include the home, bag, services, and checkout pages on mobile and desktop:

This section was written before and in the early stages of this project in a Microsoft Word document and copy and pasted into the read me near the end of the project.


### 2. Features

##### Existing Features

At the conclusion of this project, this website is fully functioning and has all of the necessary features that a fully functioning gym website would need, and the features that were set out in the user stories section.

This website is fully responsive, and designed to look good regardless of what
screen size is being used. A mobile-first approach was used when designing this website as this is the most popular device size that is currently used when surfing the internet and browsing websites, and screen size was upscaled from there and designed in a way that would make it look good on larger screens with the use of bootstrap’s column function. The site looks good on any device, with content shifting to appropriate locations on the screen as the screen size changes, providing a great user experience.

This website is easy to navigate, as it is constructed in a way that users would
expect. There is a navbar at the top with working links to each of the page’s users may wish to visit, reinforcing a sense of familiarity and adding an expected page structure that users expect, making it familiar and easy to navigate. The main content in the page is arranged in a way that makes sense and allows easy manoeuvring. Buttons have also been placed on all pages, prompting users to move throughout the website and order the service they desire, that request then moves to the bag, which in turn moves the user to the checkout, which then confirms their order. Prices and descriptions are provided for service items, encouraging users to purchase a service this establishment offers.

The title of the gym is in the navbar that displays the business' name, sat in a clean and professional white emphasising the dedication and professionalism of this gym, and it is located at the top of the page regardless of screen size for all users to see.

Furthermore, there is a welcome message on the home page to greet the user as
they enter the site, explaining the purpose of the site and how it can be used to
benefit them and meet any potential user needs.

This gym website is user friendly, allowing users read the home page to get a sense of the website’s purpose, naturally taking them to the services page to gain an interest in purchasing the gym’s services as they see the services on offer that can benefit their lives. This carries them along to the bag page where users view their order and then proceed to checkout to complete this order, which will be confirmed by the purchase success page, providing them with their purchase details. A button then invites them to return home where they can navigate back to the home page of the website, allowing users to make another purchase if they wish.

There is a footer on the page that contains the site owner's contact information. It contains an email address, allowing anyone to easily contact the site owner for any requests, and it also contains social media links linking users to the site's social media pages to follow for any future updates to the site. There is also a google maps map to display the location of the gym if they wish to visit in person.

##### Features left to implement

Due to time constraints, there is a certain could-have priority level features in the user stories section that was unable to be implemented into the project. Though unfortunate, this is not a significant issue as the priority and usefulness of these features was low and the website is still fully functioning and finished without them.

As the time is now over to work on this project, I would have liked to implement a
merge bag feature when a guest would log in and become a user but unfortunately I
ran out of time focusing on other areas of the project and had to leave it out as a result. It is a shame as the feature is almost complete as you can see in the bag app, this will be something to come back to and finish.

Adding images to the site to display the Gym would have been useful but I had
unfortunately run out of time, this does not detract from the site however.
Ideally, this would have been a great addition to the site, enhancing its usability even further. However, the lack of these features do not detract anything from the site as the purpose of this site is to display the Tony’s Gym and allow users to make a purchase, therefore it’s purpose overall is fully met.


### 3. Technologies Used

For the creation of this website many technologies were used and utilised to bring
about the end result. First of all was Git hub, the site you are probably using to view this project and README.md. The code and supporting documents were written and added to Git hub, then committed with a commit message, and then finally pushed.

The project/issues section was also utilised to arrange the user stories to monitor progress and provide insight and information on what to do next. Markup language has also been used to write up this README.md file.

Drawn out Wireframes were also used as previously seen, as well as jotting down
useful points in the early stages of this project. Though the end result is a little different to what was originally conceptualised, these provided a useful instruction to begin constructing the page structure.

An instrumental tool that was used in this project was Bootstrap Version 4. The
navbar, and buttons, were all used from bootstrap. This allowed a more efficient
development time as I was able to copy the code from the website and implement it
into the html files and spend more time fixing bugs. Therefore, I would like to
personally thank Bootstrap for its free services, allowing me to use its code for my project.

Developer Tools on Google Chrome was also a useful tool that was used in the
creation on this website. It was instrumental in getting the website to be fully
responsive, as using it I could locate where bugs were causing issues and what the
bugs were, and allowed me to test to see if the site fitted correctly onto each screen size with its responsive design feature. As of writing this I have yet to test the website with lighthouse, however the lighthouse tool in Google Chrome dev kit will be used to test this website in the next section of this README.md.

Django, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 were all used to code, and therefore
create this website. Emmet abbreviation from GitHub to code in this was a very
useful feature, as this assisted me in coding, decreasing the time spent to write out full blocks of code, allowing me to focus my attention elsewhere. Emmet
abbreviation, along with GitHub copilot helped me some write large sections of code quickly as noted in the code files. Stripe was also used in this project to manage payments in the checkout section.

The web deployment site Heroku was also used in the creation of this project, where I was able to successfully deploy this project to the web. More info on deployment and cloning below in section 5 of this README.md. 

I would also like to thank Code Institute for teaching me on how to code in Django
and Python, and on how to use many of the tools listed above. There work on
previous projects has helped me carve out ideas for myself and use them in the
creation of this website, and as already noted.

Chat GPT also assisted me in fixing some of the bugs that are noted down in the
next section. Furthermore the code institute's tutoring service also assisted in solving bugs. Code institute's Django Blog and Boutique ado projects were useful
walkthroughs, inspiring me to come up with my own ideas for this project.

I used Microsoft Copilot to autofill the services sections with snazzy names and
descriptions for the services page, saving me a lot of time to focus elsewhere such as fixing bugs.


### 5. Deployment

This project was deployed using Heroku. Code was committed to git, and then
pushed to GitHub, which Heroku then procured the pushed code to deploy this
project.

To deploy this project, please follow the steps below:

1. Create a ‘requirement.txt’ file using the terminal command ‘ pip freeze 
requirements.txt’.

2. Create a Procfile with the terminal command ‘echo web: python app.py 
procfile’.

3. ‘git add’ and ‘git commit’ the new requirements and Procfile and then ’git push’ the project to GitHub.

4. Create a new app on the Heroku website by clicking the ‘New’ button in your
dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to Europe. (You will need to
create a Heroku account and log in if you have not already done so).

5. From the Heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on
‘Deploy’, ‘Deployment Method’ and select GitHub.

6. Confirm the linking of the Heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.

7. In the Heroku dashboard for the application, click on ‘Settings’, ‘Reveal
Config Vars’.

8. Set the following config vars:

(Key – Value)

Debug – False

IP – 0.0.0.0

MONGO_URI – mongodb+srv://:@cluster_name-
qtxun.mongodb.net/database_name?retryWrites=true~=majority

PORT – 5000

SECRET_KEY – your_secret_key

To get your MONGO_URI, read the MongoDB Atlas documentation on the official
website. (Here: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)

9. In the Heroku dashboard, click ‘Deploy’.

10. In the ‘Manual Deployment’ section of this page, make sure the master branch
is selected and then click ‘Deploy Branch’.

11. The site is now successfully deployed.

At the moment of submitting this milestone project, the Development Branch and the
Master Branch are identical.

developer environment. Overall, the deployment of this website was a smooth
experience, with no issues flagging up as a result.



### 6. Credits

Firstly, I would like to thank my mentor for helping me with ideas for projects and good software development on this course.

I would also like to thank the free technologies that I have been able to use for this project, I will once again mention Bootstrap, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Chat GPT and Slack for all of these tools that have helped made coding this project possible.

I would also like to mention that I used the README.md from my last project with
Code institute as a template for this README.md. Like all good software developers,it's good to reuse code (and other things) when appropriate to do so to save time, allowing me to direct my attention elsewhere.

I would like to thank W3 as I learned some of the CSS I used for this project,
underline text in particular.

Last, and certainly not least I would like to once again thank Code Institute. I havelearned backend end software/web development with Django in a matter of weeks
thank to them and would not have been able to create this project without them.
Furthermore, the walkthrough projects (Boutique Ado inspired this project’s base
template as you can probably see) throughout this module culminating in this project have been particularly useful. I would not be here without the teaching I have received from Code institute, and hope this project shows the skills I have learned,and now have been able to implement. 

Also I’d again like to thank chat GPT who helped me create some templates noted and to rewrite some views in the bag and checkout app to fix bugs.
