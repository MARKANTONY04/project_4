#### 1. UX

##### Project Goals

The goal of this project was to create a full stack gym website with payment methods to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have learned and used over the final module in the diploma I am studying. This is to show that I have the skills, knowledge and experience of a Junior Software Developer in working with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Django, Stripe, and other technologies, with the hope of one day gaining employment within this growing and impactful industry.



##### Developer and Business Goals

The business/developer goal of this gym website is to increase sales for their gym business. By creating a website for the gym, this would advertise the gym on the internet to help gain traction to increase sales. Furthermore, describing the equipment available with costs and descriptions of all the services on offer will help to gain traction within the community, persuading people to exercise in this establishment to create a successful business by allowing people to purchase gym subscriptions online.


#### User Goals

The user goal for this site is to have a clear purpose for the site, see what gym
services they have available with appropriate descriptions. Users will also want to purchase different services from the gym, including monthly gym subscriptions,
along with other services including meal plans and classes. Easy navigation, along
with good UX principles are also required to provide a great user experience for the site’s users.

#### User Stories

Here is a link to all the information about the user stories used in this project, I recommend checking it out to see the full picture of which features were added and why. It is available to the public, meaning anyone with access to this link should in turn be able to access these user stories:

However, here is a summary of them below (in no particular order):

1. Page Layout

As someone who is unfamiliar with technology, computers, and the internet, I want
the page format to be in a standard page layout that includes a navbar, body, and
footer on each page that will allow me to easily be able to navigate this website.

2. Extensive Services

As a fitness enthusiast, I want to be able to see the all of the gym’s services on a single page, including gym subscriptions, gym classes, and nutrition guides so I can see a varied choice of services and know what I want to purchase.



3. Add to bag feature

As an avid shopper, I want to be able to shop on the go add purchases that I think I’ll want to buy to a bag, so by the time I get to checkout I can purchase everything I’ve selected at the same time.

4. Edit bag feature

As an excited shopper, I want to be able to edit, add and remove the purchases I add to my bag as I often add things I don’t need and want to increase the quantity of items I purchase, as well as the total cost.

5. Checkout feature

As an avid online shopper, I want a fully functioning checkout system, displaying the items I’ve places in my bag, allowing me to edit my order and display the total cost.

6. Services information

As a potential user of this establishment, I want to be able to see the price and
descriptions of all services this establishment offers so I can see if it’s right for me.

7. Home page

As a user who’s unaware of this establishment, I want to see the purpose of this
website on the home/welcoming page to understand the point of this website and
how it applies to me, the user.

8. Contact Details

As a user wishing to question the owner beforehand, I want a contact section with
the establishments contact details in the website’s footer so I can contact the
owner easily.

9. Location

As someone who’s new to the area and wanting to find a local gym, I want to see
the address on the website with a google maps map showing the location.

10. Pictures

As a gym enthusiast, I want to see pictures of this gym so I can know if it’s
facilities suit me.

#### Wireframes

Wireframes were used in the preparation of this project to help create the layout of the website that acted as a guide once I had commenced coding. These wireframes
were created in the inception phase of this project, as I was planning out ideas. They are seen here and include the home, bag, services, and checkout pages on mobile and desktop:
